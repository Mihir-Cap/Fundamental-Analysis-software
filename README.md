## Financial Data Analysis and Automation

### Overview
This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate the extraction, processing, and analysis of financial data related to stock trading activities. The scripts utilize web scraping techniques and data manipulation libraries to gather data from online sources and generate actionable insights for financial decision-making.

### Scripts

#### 1. Download and Consolidate Financial Data (`main.py`)
- **Functionality**: This script automates the download of CSV files from specified URLs using Selenium, reads stock symbols from these files, and consolidates the data into a unified Excel output file (`common_stocks.xlsx`).
- **Dependencies**: Requires Python 3.x with libraries including `selenium`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`. Ensure Chrome WebDriver is installed and compatible with Selenium.
- **Usage**: Modify the `url1`, `url2`, and `download_directory` variables within the script to specify the URLs and download directory. Execute the script to download, consolidate, and save the data.

#### 2. Analyze and Generate Trading Signals (`swingtrading.py`)
- **Functionality**: This script processes CSV files containing insider trading data (`CF-Insider`), shareholding patterns (`CF-Shareholding`), SAST regulations (`CF-SAST-Reg`), and pledged data (`CF-SAST-Pledged`). It calculates key metrics, evaluates conditions based on predefined criteria, and generates trading signals.
- **Dependencies**: Requires Python 3.x with libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, and `datetime`.
- **Usage**: Place the required CSV files (`CF-Insider.csv`, `CF-Shareholding.csv`, `CF-SAST-Reg.csv`, `CF-SAST-Pledged.csv`, and `EQUITY_L.csv`) in the script's working directory. Execute the script to analyze the data and generate an Excel report (`swing_trading_output.xlsx`) with trading signals and analyzed metrics.

### Getting Started
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.
   - Install necessary libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install pandas selenium openpyxl numpy
     ```

2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Adjust script parameters such as URLs, file paths, and criteria thresholds as per your specific requirements.
   - Execute each script using Python from the command line:
     ```
     python financial_data_downloader.py
     python financial_analysis.py
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The `common_stocks.xlsx` file generated by `financial_data_downloader.py` contains consolidated stock data from the specified URLs.
   - The `swing_trading_output.xlsx` file produced by `financial_analysis.py` presents trading signals and detailed metrics based on the analysis of insider trading, shareholding patterns, SAST regulations, and pledged data.

### Notes
- Ensure all required CSV files (`CF-Insider.csv`, `CF-Shareholding.csv`, `CF-SAST-Reg.csv`, `CF-SAST-Pledged.csv`, `EQUITY_L.csv`) are placed in the script's working directory before running `financial_analysis.py`.
- Customize the scripts by modifying parameters, adding additional data sources, or adjusting the analysis criteria to meet specific financial analysis and trading strategy needs.
- These scripts aim to streamline the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting financial data for informed decision-making in stock trading and investment strategies.
